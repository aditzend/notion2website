[make cert](https://dev.to/josuebustos/https-localhost-for-node-js-1p1k)

1) Add in the tarang:ssl package

meteor add tarang:ssl
2) Add your certificate and key to a directory in your app /private, e.g /private/key.pem and /private/cert.pem

Then in your /server code

Meteor.startup(function() {
    SSLProxy({
       port: 6000, //or 443 (normal port/requires sudo)
       ssl : {
            key: Assets.getText("key.pem"),
            cert: Assets.getText("cert.pem"),

            //Optional CA
            //Assets.getText("ca.pem")
       }
    });
});
Then fire up your app and load up https://localhost:6000. Be sure not to mix up your ports with https and http as they are served seperately.
